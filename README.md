# Sampling at unknown locations: Uniqueness and reconstruction under constraints

This repository contains all the code to reproduce the second part of the 
results of the paper
**Sampling at unknown locations: Uniqueness and reconstruction under 
constraints**
 by G. Elhami, M. Pacholska, A. Scholefield, B. Bejar and M. Vetterli.

In more detail, this code is generating all the figures related to polynomials 
with rational warping,
as it builds on top of code for a paper
**Sampling at Unknown Locations**, by M. Pacholska, A. Scholefield, B. Bejar and 
M. Vetterli.

Code that generated the figures form the previous paper can be found under fist 
version `v1.0`

## Abstract

Traditional sampling results assume that the sample locations are known. 
Motivated by simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and structure from 
motion (SfM), we investigate sampling at unknown locations. Without further 
constraints, the problem is often hopeless. For example, we recently showed 
that, for polynomial and bandlimited signals, it is possible to find two 
signals, arbitrarily far from each other, that fit the measurements. However, we 
also showed that this can be overcome by adding constraints to the sample 
positions.

In this paper, we show that these constraints lead to a uniform sampling of 
a composite of functions. Furthermore, the formulation retains the key aspects 
of the SLAM and SfM problems, whilst providing uniqueness, in many cases.

We demonstrate this by studying two simple examples of constrained sampling 
at unknown locations. In the first, we consider sampling a periodic bandlimited 
signal composite with an unknown linear function. We derive the sampling 
requirements for uniqueness and present an algorithm that recovers both the 
bandlimited signal and the linear warping. Furthermore, we prove that, when the 
requirements for uniqueness are not met, the cases of multiple solutions have 
measure zero.

For our second example, we consider polynomials sampled such that the 
sampling positions are constrained by a rational function. We previously proved 
that, if a specific sampling requirement is met, uniqueness is achieved. In 
addition, we present an alternate minimization scheme for solving the resulting 
non-convex optimization problem.

Finally, simulation results are provided to support our theoretical 
analysis.

## About

In order to recreate figures used in the paper related to polynomial based simulations,
one has to first run:

    python surface-tests.py
    
or, in the python console:

    `exec(open("surface-tests.py").read())`
   
Note that this script takes several hours to run on four Intel i7 cores.
After data generation all figures can be generated by Jupyter Notebook `generate_figures.ipynb`.

If you want to just have a preview how the code works, you can use Notebook `examples.ipynb`.
This notebook contains an example how to use ALS solver and how to use the whole pipeline 
(with few tests, which compute fast). 

## Requirements

This project uses Python 3. It requires:

    scipy
    matblotlib
    jupyter
    sortedcontainers
   
You can install all of them by running:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
or in the `conda` environment:

    conda install --file requirements.txt
    
Specific version of all packages used are in the file `all_requirements.txt`,
which can also be used with `pip` and `conda`.
